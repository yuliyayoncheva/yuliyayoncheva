**Co-creating the future** where artificial and human intelligence dance together in education and healthcare, I center on amplifying human agency as machines aid feedback and growth.

Building **participatory learning systems** with those who believe technology should handle computations so patients, learners, and educators can focus on context and connection â€“ fostering meaningful participation in their own care and learning.
